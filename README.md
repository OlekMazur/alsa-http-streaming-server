ALSA HTTP streaming server
==========================

A program which records audio from given ALSA device and sends it as WAV
to a bunch of clients connected to built-in very simple HTTP 1.0 server.
It can also play the recorded audio via given ALSA device (loopback) --
this is controlled via pipe.
Audio is recorded only when at least one client receives it.
Samples are internally kept in a ring buffer.
Connections to clients which cannot keep up receiving data in real time
are terminated automatically.

The program supports optional software volume control
(constant DC bias correction and amplitude multiplication).

It also supports triggering keep-alive file when audio is needed --
useful e.g. to keep V4L2 radio tuner tuned.

Example
-------
Sharing audio from *SAA7134* FM tuner built into *KNC ONE* PCI card:
```
umask 0137
exec chpst -u streamer: streamer -C hw:0,0 --info info.txt --status status.txt --keep-alive-what keep --keep-alive-to tuner/ctl --channels 2 --vol 2048+12888
```
